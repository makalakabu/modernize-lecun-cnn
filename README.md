# Convolutional Neural Network Assignment (MNIST – LeCun 1989 Replication)

This project replicates the architecture and methodology of the seminal LeCun et al. (1989) paper on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), applying the model to the MNIST digit classification task.

The assignment involves detailed analysis of the original paper, architecture replication using modern tools (e.g., PyTorch), and hands-on implementation of CNN components, including convolutional layers, nonlinearities, and fully connected output layers.

## A detailed written response and code-based implementation are included in the notebook. The questions cover:
- Understanding of CNN architecture based on the 1989 paper
- Calculations of activation sizes, filter properties, padding, stride, and initialization
- Replication of the network architecture and training process

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook
- MNIST Dataset

## Key Topics Covered
- Manual architectural breakdown of CNN from LeCun et al. (1989)
- Implementation of a CNN with 2 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers
- Use of scaled hyperbolic tangent and sigmoid activations
- Weight initialization strategies and analysis
- Use of SGD and MSE loss for training
- Batch size and stride calculations
- Evaluation of filter tiling and activation map dimensions

## Notes
This assignment demonstrates both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of early convolutional neural networks. It bridges foundational deep learning theory with modern PyTorch practice.
